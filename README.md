## 🧠 How AI is Used

We use OpenRouter’s LLaMA 3-based models (or any supported model) to:

- 🔤 Generate concise and relevant titles based on the user's note content  
- 🧠 Add context-aware intelligence to notes via prompt-based completions  

To switch to a different model (e.g., `mistralai/mixtral-8x7b`), simply update the model name in `aiService.js`.

### Example Request

```js
const response = await axios.post(
  'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions',
  {
    model: "meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are an assistant that generates short and relevant note titles.",
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: `Generate a title for this note:\n\n${content}`,
      }
    ],
    max_tokens: 20,
    temperature: 0.7,
  },
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${import.meta.env.VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
  }
);
```
